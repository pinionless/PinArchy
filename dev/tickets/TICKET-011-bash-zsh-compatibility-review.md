# TICKET-011: Bash/Zsh Compatibility Review

## User Request
Review Omarchy's bash-based scripts to ensure compatibility when switching to zsh as default shell

## Q&A
**Compatibility Scope:**
- Q: Which scripts need compatibility review?
- A: All omarchy-* utility scripts, installation scripts, and configuration scripts
- Q: Should this include third-party script compatibility?
- A: Focus on Omarchy's own scripts first, then identify potential third-party issues
- Q: What about shebang line analysis?
- A: Yes, analyze shebang usage patterns and identify scripts that need explicit bash

## Description
Focused compatibility review for shell-specific areas that will be affected when zsh becomes the default shell. Most executable scripts with #!/bin/bash shebangs will continue working, but sourced scripts and shell configurations need attention.

Review areas:
- Sourced scripts (loaded with `source` or `.`)
- Scripts without explicit shebangs
- Shell configuration files (.bashrc equivalents)
- Auto-completion scripts
- Interactive shell features (aliases, functions, prompt)
- Environment setup that depends on shell type

## Implementation Details

### Review Tasks
1. **Script Inventory**
   - Catalog all shell scripts in the project
   - Identify shebang patterns (#!/bin/bash vs #!/bin/sh)
   - Document script purposes and call patterns

2. **Compatibility Analysis**
   - Test scripts for bash-specific syntax
   - Identify potential zsh compatibility issues
   - Document required fixes or shebang changes

3. **Critical Path Testing**
   - Test core functionality (installation, theme switching)
   - Verify omarchy-* utilities work with zsh
   - Test script sourcing and execution patterns

4. **Recommendations**
   - Provide specific fixes for compatibility issues
   - Recommend shebang standardization approach
   - Document testing strategy for zsh transition

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete inventory of all shell scripts
- [ ] Compatibility analysis for each script category
- [ ] Test results for core functionality with zsh
- [ ] Document bash-specific syntax that needs changes
- [ ] Provide specific recommendations for fixes
- [ ] Create testing checklist for zsh transition
- [ ] Identify scripts requiring explicit bash shebangs
- [ ] Document any third-party script compatibility concerns
