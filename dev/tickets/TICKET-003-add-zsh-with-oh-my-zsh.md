# TICKET-003: Add zsh with oh-my-zsh

## User Request
Add zsh shell with oh-my-zsh framework as an enhanced shell option in Omarchy

## Q&A
**Shell Integration:**
- Q: Should zsh become the default shell, or remain optional alongside bash?
- A: ZSH = default
- Q: Should this be installed in the main system setup, or as an optional component?
- A: We should review how bash is setup and add zsh in similar way

**Theme Integration:**
- Q: Should oh-my-zsh themes automatically match Omarchy's color schemes?
- A: we will not use oh-my-zsh themes, we will use powerline OR starship. And YES. we will use different themes
- Q: Should `omarchy-theme-set` automatically update zsh themes too?
- A: YES

**Plugin Configuration:**
- Q: Which oh-my-zsh plugins should be enabled by default?
- A: we check what is installed for bash, THIS REASEARCH SHOULD BE SEPERATE TICKET
- Q: Should we create Omarchy-specific zsh configurations, or use oh-my-zsh defaults?
- A: I have my own zshrc, we will do something extra

**Compatibility:**
- Q: How should we ensure Omarchy's bash-based scripts continue working if user switches to zsh?
- A: We should make a review of this. THIS REASEARCH SHOULD BE A SEPERATE TICKET

## Description
Make zsh the default shell in Omarchy with powerline/starship theming integration, following the same installation patterns as bash setup.

Key requirements:
- Install zsh and oh-my-zsh framework following bash setup patterns
- Make zsh the default shell (replacing bash)
- Use powerline OR starship for theming (not oh-my-zsh themes)
- Integrate with omarchy-theme-set for automatic theme switching
- Custom zshrc configuration based on user preferences
- Research bash plugins/setup to match functionality (separate ticket)
- Review bash/zsh script compatibility (separate ticket)
