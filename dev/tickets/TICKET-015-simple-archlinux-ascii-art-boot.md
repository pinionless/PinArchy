4. **Any specific requirements for TTY compatibility?** simpler

## Description
Replace the current complex braille character ASCII art in boot.sh with simpler ASCII art that displays "archlinux". The current art uses braille characters and ANSI color codes that don't render well in TTY environments. Need clean, simple ASCII art using basic characters that works reliably across all terminal types.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace complex braille ASCII art with simple character-based art
- [ ] ASCII art displays "archlinux" text
- [ ] Works properly in TTY environments without color support
- [ ] Uses only basic ASCII characters (no Unicode/braille)
- [ ] Maintains visual appeal while being TTY-compatible
- [ ] Remove or simplify ANSI color codes for better TTY compatibility
