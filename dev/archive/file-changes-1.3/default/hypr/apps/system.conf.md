## ðŸš¨ MERGE GUIDANCE
**CRITICAL TO PRESERVE**: Removed references to `org.gnome.NautilusPreviewer` and `zoom` - do not restore them  
**SAFE TO UPDATE**: Other window rules can accept upstream improvements  
**CONFLICT RESOLUTION**: Keep the streamlined class lists, merge other window rule functionality

## Change Summary
Removed window rules for applications that were streamlined away (Nautilus previewer and Zoom)

## Reasoning
Part of application streamlining - removed window rules for applications that were removed from the system:
- `org.gnome.NautilusPreviewer`: Removed as part of file manager replacement (change 003) - Nautilus replaced with Krusader  
- `zoom`: Removed as part of bloat removal (change 004) - Zoom not needed for minimal system
