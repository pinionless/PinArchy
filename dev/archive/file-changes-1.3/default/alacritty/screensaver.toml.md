**SAFE TO UPDATE**: N/A - file is intentionally removed  
**CONFLICT RESOLUTION**: If upstream adds this file back, delete it again

## Change Summary
Deleted Alacritty screensaver configuration template as part of terminal replacement (Alacritty â†’ Ghostty)

## Diff
```diff
-[Deleted entire screensaver.toml file with Alacritty screensaver configuration template]
```

## Reasoning
Removed as part of system-wide terminal replacement (change 001) - Ghostty terminal is used instead of Alacritty, so Alacritty screensaver template is no longer needed. Replaced by default/ghostty/screensaver.config.
