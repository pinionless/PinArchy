## ðŸš¨ MERGE GUIDANCE
**CRITICAL TO PRESERVE**: Terminal must use `ghostty`, file manager must use `krusader`, replaced application bindings  
**SAFE TO UPDATE**: Other keybindings and system functionality can accept upstream changes  
**CONFLICT RESOLUTION**: Keep ghostty/krusader/firefox/bitwarden references, merge other keybindings
