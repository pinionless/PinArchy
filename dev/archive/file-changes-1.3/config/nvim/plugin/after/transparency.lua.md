# config/nvim/plugin/after/transparency.lua

## ðŸš¨ MERGE GUIDANCE
**CRITICAL TO PRESERVE**: This file must remain deleted - do not restore it  
**SAFE TO UPDATE**: N/A - file is intentionally removed  
**CONFLICT RESOLUTION**: If upstream adds this file back, delete it again

## Change Summary
Deleted Neovim transparency plugin configuration as part of editor simplification (nvim â†’ nano)

## Diff
```diff
-[Deleted entire transparency.lua file with Neovim transparency plugin configuration]
```

## Reasoning
Removed as part of editor replacement (change 002) - LazyVim/Neovim replaced with nano as default text editor, so Neovim plugin configurations are no longer needed.
