## ðŸš¨ MERGE GUIDANCE

**SAFE TO UPDATE**: N/A - file is intentionally removed  
**CONFLICT RESOLUTION**: If upstream adds this file back, delete it again

## Change Summary
Deleted LazyVim configuration file as part of editor simplification (nvim â†’ nano)

## Diff
```diff
-[Deleted entire lazyvim.json file with LazyVim configuration]
```

## Reasoning
Removed as part of editor replacement (change 002) - LazyVim/Neovim replaced with nano as default text editor, so LazyVim configuration is no longer needed.
