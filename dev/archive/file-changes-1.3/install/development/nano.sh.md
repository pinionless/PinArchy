# install/development/nano.sh

## ðŸš¨ MERGE GUIDANCE

**CONFLICT RESOLUTION**: Keep this file, merge any upstream enhancements

## Change Summary
Added nano installation script as part of editor replacement (nvim â†’ nano)

## Diff
```diff
+[Added entire nano.sh file with nano installation and configuration]
```
