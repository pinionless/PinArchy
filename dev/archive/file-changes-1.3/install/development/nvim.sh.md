**SAFE TO UPDATE**: N/A - file is intentionally removed  
**CONFLICT RESOLUTION**: If upstream adds this file back, delete it again

## Change Summary
Deleted Neovim installation script as part of editor replacement (nvim â†’ nano)

## Diff
```diff
-[Deleted entire nvim.sh file with Neovim/LazyVim installation and configuration]
```

## Reasoning
Removed as part of editor replacement (change 002) - LazyVim/Neovim replaced with nano as the default text editor, so the nvim installation script is no longer needed. Replaced by install/development/nano.sh.
