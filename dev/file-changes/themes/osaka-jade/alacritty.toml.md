## ðŸš¨ MERGE GUIDANCE

**SAFE TO UPDATE**: N/A - file is intentionally removed  
**CONFLICT RESOLUTION**: If upstream adds this file back, delete it again

## Change Summary
Deleted Alacritty terminal theme file as part of terminal replacement (Alacritty â†’ Ghostty)

## Diff
```diff
-[Deleted entire alacritty.toml file with osaka-jade color scheme for Alacritty terminal]
```

## Reasoning
Removed as part of system-wide terminal replacement - Ghostty terminal is used instead of Alacritty, so Alacritty theme files are no longer needed.
