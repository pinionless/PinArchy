**SAFE TO UPDATE**: N/A - file is intentionally removed  
**CONFLICT RESOLUTION**: If upstream adds this file back, delete it again

## Change Summary
Deleted Alacritty main configuration file as part of terminal replacement (Alacritty â†’ Ghostty)

## Diff
```diff
-[Deleted entire alacritty.toml file with main terminal configuration]
```

## Reasoning
Removed as part of system-wide terminal replacement (change 001) - Ghostty terminal is used instead of Alacritty, so Alacritty configuration is no longer needed. Replaced by config/ghostty/config.
