## Files Modified

### Modified Files  
- `install/apps/personal.sh` - Added three application packages and updated personal installation section
- `config/hypr/bindings.conf` - Updated keyboard bindings for all applications and reorganized Google Sheets binding

## Changes Made

### Package Installation (personal.sh)
- **Added Thunderbird**: Official `thunderbird` package from Arch repositories
- **Added Firefox**: Official `firefox` package from Arch repositories  
- **Added Plexamp**: `plexamp-appimage` package from AUR with flaky package handling
- **Removed placeholder text**: Replaced "No personal packages configured yet" with actual implementations
- **Error handling**: Plexamp uses individual install loop for AUR package reliability

### Keyboard Bindings (bindings.conf)
- **Super+E**: Changed from Google Sheets ‚Üí **Thunderbird** (email client)
- **Super+S**: **New binding** for Google Sheets (moved from Super+E)
- **Super+B**: Changed from Chromium ‚Üí **Firefox** (browser)  
- **Super+M**: **New binding** for **Plexamp** (music player)
- **Application launch**: All use `uwsm app -- [application]` pattern for proper window management

### Waybar Media Controls (config.jsonc)
- **MPRIS Module**: Added built-in `mpris` module to modules-right array
- **Media Controls**: Click to play/pause, right-click for next track, scroll for track navigation
- **Visual Indicators**: Player-specific icons (üéµ default, üìª for Plexamp) and status icons (‚ñ∂‚è∏‚èπ)
- **Smart Filtering**: Ignores Firefox media to prevent web content interference
- **Tooltip**: Shows current player, artist, and track information
- **Positioning**: Placed between tray and bluetooth modules in status bar

## Migration Required
- [x] No - Changes apply automatically via refresh/update

### Migration Details (if required)
N/A - All changes use existing Omarchy patterns and will be applied during next configuration refresh or update cycle.

## Testing
- [x] Tested on fresh installation - All packages install correctly via personal.sh
- [x] Tested on existing installation - Configuration updates work seamlessly  
- [x] Tested configuration refresh - Keyboard bindings update without system restart
- [x] Tested theme switching (if applicable) - No theme conflicts with new applications

## Notes

### Application Integration Details
**Thunderbird (TICKET-006)**:
- No automated email account setup (by design)
- No theme integration (technical limitations documented in ticket)
- System notifications integration relies on default Thunderbird behavior
- Replaces Google Sheets on Super+E shortcut as requested

**Firefox (TICKET-007)**:
- Installed alongside Chromium (not replaced)
- Chromium remains available via application launcher
- Webapp launcher continues using Chromium for consistency
- No theme integration (technical limitations documented in ticket)
- Takes over Super+B shortcut from Chromium

**Plexamp (TICKET-008)**:
- Uses AppImage version for better compatibility
- Full MPRIS integration for media controls via Waybar
- No server pre-configuration (user must connect to Plex server)
- Media key integration works through MPRIS protocol

### Keyboard Binding Changes Summary
```
BEFORE ‚Üí AFTER
Super+E: Google Sheets ‚Üí Thunderbird
Super+B: Chromium ‚Üí Firefox  
Super+S: [unbound] ‚Üí Google Sheets
Super+M: [unbound] ‚Üí Plexamp
```

### Waybar Media Controls Features
- **Compatibility**: Works with Plexamp, Spotify, VLC, MPV, and other MPRIS2-compliant players
- **Multi-player Support**: Automatically follows currently active player

- **Integration**: Seamlessly fits into existing Waybar theme and layout

### Implementation Strategy

- **System Integration**: Follows existing Omarchy patterns and conventions
- **User Experience**: Logical keyboard mappings (E=Email, S=Sheets, B=Browser, M=Music)
